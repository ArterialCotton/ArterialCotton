- 👋 Hi, I’m @ArterialCotton
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to use this website and code in general. I'm learning on the fly.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to navigate this website.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment due to me not knowing how to even navigate this website.
- 📫 How to reach me ... I have no idea.
